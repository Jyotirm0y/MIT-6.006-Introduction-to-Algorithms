15.1-1  
Show that equation (15.4) follows from equation (15.3) and the initial condition T(0) = 1 

[Check the answer here on math stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2343977/geometric-series-transformation-introduction-to-algorithms-15-1-1)

By the way, the initial condition T(0)=1 is very important here, change it and I don't know what the answer will be like...


15.1-2

Let p1 = 0, p2 = 4, p3 = 7 and n = 4. The greedy strategy would first cut
off a piece of length 3 since it has highest density. The remaining rod has length
1, so the total price would be 7. On the other hand, two rods of length 2 yield
a price of 8.

Rod-cutting with cost of each cutting
```
import sys

def cut_rod_bottom_up(price,n,c):
    r=[-sys.maxsize-1]*(n+1)
    r[0]=0
    for j in range(1,n+1):
        q=-sys.maxsize-1
        for i in range(0,j-1):
            q=max(q,price[i]+r[j-i-1]-c)   #notice price[j-1] is not a cut at all, it it altogher not to cut , so change the loop 
        q=max(q, price[j-1])
        r[j]=q
    return r[n]
```
```
import sys

def cut_rod_bottom_up(price,n):
    r=[-sys.maxsize-1]*(n+1)
    s=[-1]*n
    r[0]=0
    for j in range(1,n+1):
        q=-sys.maxsize-1
        for i in range(0,j-1):
            if q<price[i]+r[j-1-i]-c:
                q=price[i]+r[j-1-i]-c
                s[j-1]=i
        if q<price[j-1]:
          q=price[j-1]
          s[j-1]=j-1
        r[j]=q
    return r,s 

def print_cut_rod_solution(price,n):
    (r,s)=cut_rod_bottom_up(price,n)
    while n>0:
        print("{}\n".format(s[n-1)+1))
       n-=s[n-1]+1
```
