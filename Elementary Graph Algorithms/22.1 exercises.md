## 22.1-1
Given an adjacency-list representation of a directed graph, how long does it take to compute the out-degree of every vertex? How long does it take to compute the in-degrees?

`Out-degree`: O(|E|+|V|) or O(|V|)(if you have recorded the length of each list as a attribute of a vertex)

`In-degree`: O(|E|+|V|)

## 22.1-2 
Give an adjacency-list representation for a complete binary tree on 7 vertices. Give an equivalent adjacency-matrix representation. Assume that vertices are numbered from 1 to 7 as in a binary heap.

## 22.1-3

The transpose of a directed graph G = (V, E) is the graph GT = (V, E^T), where E^T = {(v, u) in V × V : (u, v) in E}. Thus, G^T is G with all its edges reversed. Describe efficient algorithms for computing GT from G, for both the adjacency-list and adjacency-matrix representations of G. Analyze the running times of your algorithms.

where T means transpose.

`Ajacency matrix notation`: just transpose the matrix 

`Adjacency list notation`: 
```
for each vertex u in V (G) 
  do add u to V(G') 
for each vertex u in V (G) 
  do for each v in Adj (G) [u] 
    do add u to Adj (G') [v] 
 ```
 O(|V|+|E|)
 
 ## 22.1.-4 
 Given an adjacency-list representation of a multigraph G = (V, E), describe an O(V + E)-time algorithm to compute the adjacency-list representation of the "equivalent" undirected graph G′ = (V, E′), where E′ consists of the edges in E with all multiple edges between two vertices replaced by a single edge and with all self-loops removed.
 
 
 
 
 
 ## 22.1-5 
 The *square* of a directed graph  G=(V,E)  is the graph  G^2=(V,E^2)  such that  (u,v)∈E^2  if and only  G  contains a path with at most two edges between  u  and  v . Describe efficient algorithms for computing  G^2  from  G  for both the adjacency-list and adjacency-matrix representations of  G . Analyze the running times of your algorithms.

 Just compute A^2, can be done with Strassen algorithm
