## 22.1-1
Given an adjacency-list representation of a directed graph, how long does it take to compute the out-degree of every vertex? How long does it take to compute the in-degrees?

`Out-degree`: O(|E|+|V|) or O(|V|)(if you have recorded the length of each list as a attribute of a vertex)

`In-degree`: O(|E|+|V|)
