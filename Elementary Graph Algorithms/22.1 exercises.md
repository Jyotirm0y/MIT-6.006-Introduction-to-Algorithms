## 22.1-1
Given an adjacency-list representation of a directed graph, how long does it take to compute the out-degree of every vertex? How long does it take to compute the in-degrees?

`Out-degree`: O(|E|+|V|) or O(|V|)(if you have recorded the length of each list as a attribute of a vertex)

`In-degree`: O(|E|+|V|)

## 22.1-2 
Give an adjacency-list representation for a complete binary tree on 7 vertices. Give an equivalent adjacency-matrix representation. Assume that vertices are numbered from 1 to 7 as in a binary heap.

## 22.1-3

The transpose of a directed graph G = (V, E) is the graph GT = (V, E^T), where E^T = {(v, u) in V Ã— V : (u, v) in E}. Thus, G^T is G with all its edges reversed. Describe efficient algorithms for computing GT from G, for both the adjacency-list and adjacency-matrix representations of G. Analyze the running times of your algorithms.

where T means transpose.

`Ajacency matrix notation`: just transpose the matrix
